*Velociraptor* is a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived approximately 75 to 71 million years ago during the later part of the Cretaceous Period, with species discovered in Mongolia, China.

Fossils of dromaeosaurids more primitive than *Velociraptor* are known to have had feathers covering their bodies and fully developed feathered wings. The fact that the ancestors of *Velociraptor* were feathered and possibly capable of flight had long suggested to paleontologists that Velociraptor bore feathers as well, since even flightless birds today retain most of their feathers.
