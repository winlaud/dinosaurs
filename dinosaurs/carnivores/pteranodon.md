Pteranodon is a genus of pterosaurs which included some of the largest known flying reptiles, with wingspans over 6 metres. It existed during the late Cretaceous geological period of North America. More fossil specimens of *Pteranodon* have been found than any other pterosaur, with about 1 200 specimens known to science, many of them well preserved with nearly complete skulls and articulated skeletons.

Adult *Pteranodon* specimens from the two major species can be divided into two distinct size classes. The smaller class of specimens have small, rounded head crests and very wide pelvic canals, even wider than those of the much larger size class. The size of the pelvic canal probably allowed the laying of eggs, indicating that these smaller adults are females. The larger size class, representing male individuals, have narrow hips and very large crests, which were probably for display.
