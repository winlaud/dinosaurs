*Tyrannosaurus* (meaning “tyrant lizard”) is a genus of coelurosaurian theropod dinosaur. The species *Tyrannosaurus rex* (rex meaning "king" in Latin), commonly abbreviated to *T. rex*, is a fixture in popular culture. It lived throughout what is now western North America, at the time an island continent termed Laramidia, with a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids.

Like other tyrannosaurids, *Tyrannosaurus* was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to the large and powerful hindlimbs, *Tyrannosaurus* forelimbs were small, though unusually powerful for their size, and bore two clawed digits.
