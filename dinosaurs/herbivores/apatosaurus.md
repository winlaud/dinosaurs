*Apatosaurus*, including the popular but scientifically redundant synonym *Brontosaurus*, is a genus of sauropod dinosaur that lived from about 154 to 150 million years ago, during the Jurassic Period (Kimmeridgian and early Tithonian ages).

The cervical vertebrae were less elongated and more heavily constructed than those of *Diplodocus* and the bones of the leg were much stockier (despite being longer), implying a more robust animal. The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion. Like most sauropods, *Apatosaurus* had only a single large claw on each forelimb, with the first three toes on the hind limb possessing claws.
